Timers. Exercise

Answer the following questions:

1. What is the difference between setInterval and setTimeout?

The main difference is that the setTimeout function will only run the callback function to be executed once, whereas setInterval will run it an infinite amount of times (until the timer is cleared).

2. What is the difference between using setInterval and a loop? Why would you want to choose one over the other?

The setInterval takes in two parameters, the first parameter is a callback function and the second is time in milliseconds. While, the "Event Loop", is an internal JavaScript operation which checks the queue and sees if there are any processes to execute.

3. What is the first parameter that setInterval and setTimeout accept?

setTimeout and setInterval take in as their first parameter a function!

4. Why is it so important to store the result of setInterval and setTimeout in a variable?

So that the result of setInterval and setTimeout can be passed as a parameter to another function as a callback!

5. What does asynchronous mean in the context of setTimeout and setInterval?

asynchronous code is code that will be executed at a later point in time.
