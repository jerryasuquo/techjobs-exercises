1. Create the following variables
name, which is a string set to your current name
dayOfBirth, which is a number set to the day of your birth month
let name = "Harrison Justin";
let dayOfBirth = "07-08-14";

4. Create a string that contains both single quotes and double quotes.
"Harrison said" + ' I have a ' + favoriteColor + "ring"

7. You can declare a variable by typing let thing;. What is the value of thing?
The value of thing would be undefined, since a value was not assigned to thing explicitly.
