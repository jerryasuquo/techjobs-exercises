1. Given the following object below, write code to print the value then the key to the console separated by '=>':

let namesAndHobbies = {
    elie: "JavaScript",
    matt: "jogging",
    janey: "table building",
    tim: "sailing"
}

for (key in namesAndHobbies) {
  console.log(`${namesAndHobbies[key]} => ${key}`);
}

2. Add a key for your name, and a value for your favorite hobby to the namesAndHobbies object.

namesAndHobbies.name = "Elie";
namesAndHobbies["favoriteHobby"] = "Dance";

3. Write an if statement that console.logs your name and hobby to the console if the key of your name is contained in the object.

if ("name" in namesAndHobbies && "favoriteHobby" in namesAndHobbies) {
   console.log(namesAndHobbies.name, namesAndHobbies["favoriteHobby"]);
}
