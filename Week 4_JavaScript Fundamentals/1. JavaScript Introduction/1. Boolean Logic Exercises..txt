Boolean Logic Exercises. 

Part I
Write down what the following statements will return. Try to figure this out before putting the commands in the chrome console.


1. 2 == "2"; // -> true
2. 2 === 2; // -> true
3. 10 % 3; // -> 1
4. 10 % 3 === 1; // -> true
5. true && false; // -> false
6. false || true; // -> true
7. true || false; // -> true



Part II
Answer the following questions about this code block:
let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}



1. What should the above code console.log?
// -> Keep it up!

2. Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
// -> We do not need to specify if(isLearning === true) because, we have already assigned the value of true to the isLearning variable above the if condition, so we do not need to repeat the assignment. The if(isLearning) work on its own because the if condition primarily checks for if the parameter(s) within the parenthesis is true or not, and then it now evaluates the statements inside the block.





let firstvariable;
let secondvariable = "";
let thirdvariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstvariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}



1. What should the above code console.log? Why?
// -> third, because firstvariable has no value assigned to it and would be provided with an automatic undefined variable, secondvariable is assigned an empty string that evaluates to a falsy. The thirdvariable variable has a value that is truthy.

2. What is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized? // -> undefined

3. Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
// -> It is not truthy, because the firstvariable has no value assigned to it and would be provided with an automatic value of undefined.

4. Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
// -> It is not truthy, because the secondvariable is assigned an empty string that evaluates to a falsy value.

5. Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
// -> It is truthy, because the thirdvariable is assigned to a number that evaluates to a truthy value.



Part III
Research Math.random here and write an if statement that console.log's "Over 0.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 0.5. Otherwise console.log "Under 0.5".

if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    console.log("Over 0.5");
} else {
    console.log("Under 0.5");
}

What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.

In JavaScript there are 6 falsey values:

0
""
null
undefined
false
NaN (short for not a number)
