Answer the following questions:

1. What does the throw keyword do?

When we want to throw an error when something is done incorrectly in our application, we use the throw keyword followed by an error object to return an error and stop code execution.

2. What does the finally keyword do?

Inside of the finally block, code will execute regardless of an error being thrown.

3. What is the difference between a TypeError and ReferenceError?

ReferenceError occurs when we try to access a variable that does not exist in that scope. While, TypeError occurs when you make incorrect use of certain types in javascript.

6. How do we "catch" errors in JavaScript? Give an example with code for what that might look like.

To "catch" errors in JavaScript, we use a try / catch statement. We place code inside of the try block (a block is defined as code inside of a {}) and if an error is thrown, the code moves to the catch block. After the catch block, code continues to execute.

try {
    thisDoesNotExist;
} catch(e) {
    console.log("The error is ", e);
}
