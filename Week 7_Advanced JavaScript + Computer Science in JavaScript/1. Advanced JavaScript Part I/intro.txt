Think about how you would design a game of checkers. What data do you want to save? What components are involved in a checkers game that we could turn into a class? What would the relationship be between one class and another?

When thinking about a game of checkers. Some larger processes and objects stand out that you will want to capture in your code:

Block
White checker
Black checker
The checker
Show moves
Execute move
Check move
Change turns
Player
Bets

Each one of these components could be a class in your program. Let's pick one of the potential classes and figure out the data that it will hold and the functions that it should be able to perform:

Attack moves - check if I have any attack movement
Check move - IF I CAN'T ATTACK I CHECK IF I CAN GO
Execute move - exchange coordinates of the moved part
